Q. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

A. Data can be mined from our songs database with the following statements:

Energy = SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs;

Valence = SELECT AVG(valence)
FROM songs;

Danceability = SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM songs;

Where Audio Aura = Energy + Valence + Danceability

Q. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not
be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating
this aura would you propose?

A. The way we calculated the audio aura does not take into account the actual
playtime of these songs. If we had more data regarding the users listening
habits we could make a better calculation of their Aura. i.e. Just because
someone has a song in their playlist does not mean it was at the top of the
most played. Perhaps adding another table that keeps track of how many times
each song is played and factoring this into our equation.
